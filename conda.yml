# Install anaconda or miniconda first from anaconda.org
# Open an Anaconda prompt and cd to this directory
# or provide the full path to this file.  
# > conda env create --file conda.yml
# This creates an environment called recognizer.  Like all conda
# environments, you must activate the environment before using it.
# For using an IDE, you will need to point the IDE to the Python
# instance that was installed.  Anaconda places each environment
# in a subdirectory of envs.
#
# USING A GPU ========================================
# If you have an Nvidia GPU, you should be able to substitute tensorflow-gpu
# for tensorflow and add the following dependencies:
# - cudnn
# - cudatoolkit
#
# While Anaconda is usually pretty good about setting up GPUs, I have
# occasionally had problems with this and had to install the cudnn and
# the cudatoolkit manually.  See https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu
# but if you are only doing it for this project it may be more trouble
# than it is worth.
#
# You can check if the GPU is configured correctly by the following:
# >conda activate recognizer
# (call-recognizer) python
# >> import tensorflow as tf
# >> tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
# The GPU should show up as a device in the list.
